# Lizz Smullen's Technical Writing Porfolio

Hi! My name is Lizz Smullen. Welcome to my technical writing portfolio. I hope that you enjoy reading my technical writing as much as I did creating it.

## Technical Writing at Tubi

Here's some of the interesting content that I wrote for Tubi.

### Ad blog series

I wrote an Ad blog series that describes technical process that Tubi uses to sell, promote and personalize ads. Each blog was written from scratch, using Tubi Engineering documentation and ChatGPT. The purpose of these blogs was to teach new hires the different ways that Tubi works with ads.

### Tubi Engineering Medium blogs

As the managing editor for Tubi Engineering's Medium Home Page, I worked with engineers to enhance their technical blogs. The process involved rewriting, restructuring and reorganizing existing content to make it more clear, concise and interesting. I also would meet with Tubi engineers from Beijing to create blog posts. 

The following are two blogs with two Beijing Engineers. The first one describes why Tubi decided to switch from a two-player system to a single player system. The second blog describes the technology behind the new single player.
