### ðŸ’– Writing is my passion ðŸ’–	

Iâ€™m a journalist and technical writer with a knack for finding compelling stories and making complex topics easy to understand.

As a reporter for the Monadnock Ledger-Transcript in Peterborough, NH, I covered four towns that had been frustrated by a lack of local news. Within my first month, circulation in those areas increased by 13%, which is well above the typical 3-4% bump when a new reporter starts. I built strong relationships with selectmen, police chiefs, and fire chiefs, which helped me uncover important storiesâ€”many of which landed on the front page, including under the fold. My reporting earned first place for Spot News and Investigative Reporting from the New Hampshire Press Association, and I was part of a team that received the Dennis Joos Memorial Award for courageous journalism.

My writing career started in the U.S. Air Force, where I developed the first Onboarding and Suggestion Programs for the 36th Services Squadron at Bitburg Air Base, Germany. After leaving the military, I studied both journalism and technical writing in Boston, which gave me a strong foundation in both storytelling and structured communication.

Alongside journalism, Iâ€™ve spent 30 years as a technical writer, creating documentation from scratch for industries ranging from e-learning to manufacturing. While at a manufacturing company, I trained documentation assistants in technical writing and developed phonetic work instructions to help non-native English speakers learn to read American English while building products independently.

I also enjoy helping others refine their writing. As the managing editor for Tubiâ€™s Engineering Homepage on Medium, I worked with engineers in the U.S. and Beijing to make their technical blogs clear and engaging. To make the process easier, I built a Publishing Hub in Notion, giving them a structured workflow for content creation.

Whether Iâ€™m reporting on local issues or writing technical content, my goal is always the same: to communicate information in a way thatâ€™s clear, engaging, and meaningful.
