### ðŸ’– Technical Writing is my passion ðŸ’–	

I have been a technical writer for 33 years. I excel at distilling complex instructions and teachings into compelling, interesting, and understandable content. My specialty is creating something out of nothing. I have made multiple doc libraries from scratch, migrated hundreds of technical pages, edited all kinds of engineering blogs for publishing, and have written all types of technical documentation, including user guides, admin guides, installation guides, programming guides, interface guides, and RestAPIs for many high tech companies, incuding Dell, HP, and VMware. I also spent some time technical writing for the entertainment industry, working as Tubi's first technical writer.

### ðŸ’– News writing thrills me ðŸ’–	 

I had always wanted to be a news writer. I knew I would be good at it, and I was. Once my tech writing career was secure, I began freelancing for the Boston Business Journal and the Revere Journal. I wrote about everything from amateur investment clubs to the latest wedding gowns to local high school sports. 

When I moved to New Hampshire, I became a reporter for the Monadnock Ledger-Transcript in Peterborough, NH. My beat included four towns that didn't take kindly to reporters. I attended community suppers, town meetings, selectmen meetings, school board meetings, and pretty much anywhere else there was an event taking place. I knew I could change things by writing their stories. One month after I started, circulation in those areas increased by 13%, which is far above the typical 3-4% bump when a new reporter starts. I made it a point to build strong relationships with selectmen, police chiefs, fire chiefs, and the residents. My stories continuously made the front page, including under the fold. The people in the towns were happy too, because they were getting much-deserved recognition for their achievements. I competed in a few New Hampshire Press Association contests. I won multiple awards, including first place for Spot News and Investigative Reporting, as well as the Dennis Joos Memorial Award for courageous journalism.

### ðŸ’– My writing career started in the USAF ðŸ’–	

My writing career started in the U.S. Air Force, where I wrote the first Onboarding and Suggestion Programs for the 36th Services Squadron at Bitburg Air Base, Germany. It is also where I got my start managing publication libraries. After leaving the military, I studied both journalism and technical writing in Boston, where I also began my tech writing career.
