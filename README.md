### More about me 
About Me by Lizz Smullen

I have over 30 years as a technical writer, but I got my start as a professional writer while a member of the United States Air Force. While stationed at Bitburg Air Base, Germany, I wrote my squadron’s first Onboarding Program and Suggestion Program. 

After leaving the military, I went to school for technical writing. One of my strongest skills is to write technical content from scratch. I’m really good at creating something out of nothing. In the past, I have created documentation sets for several companies, including an online auction house, a global education publisher, and a learning platform.  

While at a manufacturing company, I trained documentation assistants how to technically write, and taught production assistants how to read American-English by creating phonetic work instructions that contained both images and words that helped them independently build products.  

Today, I still help others to write compelling content. When I was the managing editor for Tubi’s Engineering Homepage on Medium, I helped engineers from Beijing and the United States to write clear, concise technical blogs. One way I did this was by creating a Publishing Hub in Notion specifically for them to use when creating technical content.  

While a technical writer, I also worked as a newspaper reporter for the Monadnock Ledger Transcript in Peterborough, NH. During my first month as a reporter, I increased circulation in the four towns I was responsible for by 14%. Typically, when a new reporter joins, there is a circulation increase of about 3-4%. At the time, the towns were frustrated by the lack of news coverage that they were receiving. As their local reporter, I found lots of interesting and provocative content to write about. These stories not only made the front page, but they made the front page under the fold. The residents loved the coverage. As a result, I established contacts with selectmen and other local government officials like police chiefs, and fire chiefs. My stories won first place for Spot News and Investigative Reporting in the New Hampshire Press Association Distinguished Journalist Contest. In addition, I was part of a team that received the Dennis Joos Memorial Award for courageous journalism.
