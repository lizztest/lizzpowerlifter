# Lizz Smullen's Technical and News Writing Porfolio

ðŸŒž Welcome to my technical writing portfolio! I hope that you enjoy reading my technical writing samples as much as I did creating them.

## Technical Writing at Tubi

Here's some of the interesting content that I wrote for Tubi.

### Ad Blog Series

I wrote an Ad blog series that describes the technical process that Tubi follows to sell, promote and personalize ads. Each blog was written from scratch, using Tubi Engineering documentation and ChatGPT. The purpose of these blogs was to teach new hires the different ways that Tubi works with ads.

- **[How Tubi uses Real-Time Bidding to Sell Ads](https://github.com/lizztest/lizzpowerlifter/blob/main/How%20Tubi%20uses%20Real-Time%20Bidding%20to%20Sell%20Ads%207aab1ffe49a0400a959c952360cdc3d7.pdf)**
- **[How Customized Ads Personalize the Tubi User Experience](https://github.com/lizztest/lizzpowerlifter/blob/main/How%20Customized%20Ads%20Personalize%20the%20Tubi%20User%20Exper%2041e845f1383c45688f9567504f37754a.pdf)**
- **[How Tubi Uses Dynamic Metrics to Track the Cost and Performance of an Ad Campaign](https://github.com/lizztest/lizzpowerlifter/blob/main/How%20Tubi%20Uses%20Dynamic%20Metrics%20to%20Track%20the%20Cost%20an%20fdbdcee1ca42479e8bf98dabe8e01d6a.pdf)**
- **[How Dynamic Pacing, Frequency, and Placement Optimizes Ad Performance at Tubi](https://github.com/lizztest/lizzpowerlifter/blob/main/How%20Dynamic%20Pacing,%20Frequency,%20and%20Placement%20Optimizes%20Ad%20Performance%20at%20Tubi.pdf)**

### Tubi Engineering Medium Blogs

As the managing editor for **[Tubi Engineering's Medium Home Page](https://code.tubitv.com/)**, it was my job to publish technical content. The process involved new writing, rewriting, restructuring and reorganizing draft content written by engineers so that it would be more clear, concise and compelling. Part of my responsibilities included meeting with individual engineers to help write their blog posts. 

I wrote the following two blogs with content provided by two Beijing Engineers. The first blog describes why Tubi decided to switch from a two-player system to a single player system to stream content. The second blog describes the technology behind the new single player.

* **[How a Seamless Play Single-Player Improved the Tubi Viewing Experience](https://code.tubitv.com/how-a-seamless-play-single-player-improved-the-tubi-viewing-experience-70933bcb68f9)**
* **[Tubiâ€™s New Android Player Architecture Supports All Playback Scenarios](https://code.tubitv.com/tubis-new-android-player-architecture-supports-all-playback-scenarios-322ee3a7153c)**
* **[Tubi-a-thon](https://code.tubitv.com/tubi-a-thon-2023-1624ac03056)**

### Tubi's Behind-the-Scenes Fireside Tech Chats

During the summer, Tubi held Behind-the-Scenes Fireside Tech Chats with prominent leaders in technology. During the tech chat, I would type the entire conversation, then write key takeaways that would benefit emerging leaders. The key takeaways were published on Medium and LinkedIn.

## Technical Writing at VMware

As the sole tech writer for Tanzu Services and Solutions. I spent my time editing and rewriting a lot of technical content for the Tanzu Development Center. I also wrote my own blogs, including one about the cost of migrating to Kubernetes, and a learning path on how to create a cash card using a Rest API and Spring Boot. Both of these are behind a paywall that I cannot access. 

To help engineers write their own structured learning paths, I wrote a **[Spring Style Guide](https://github.com/lizztest/lizzpowerlifter/blob/main/Spring%20Style%20Guide.pdf)** to help them get started.
