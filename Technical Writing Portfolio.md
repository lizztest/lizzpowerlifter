## Technical Writing at Tubi

Here's some of the interesting content that I wrote for Tubi.

### Tubi Engineering Medium Blogs

As the managing editor for **[Tubi Engineering's Medium Home Page](https://code.tubitv.com/)**, I was responsible for publishing technical content that was clear, concise, and engaging. This involved everything from new writing to rewriting, restructuring, and refining draft content from engineers to improve clarity and readability.

A key part of my role was working directly with engineers, helping them shape their blog posts into compelling narratives. I also ghostwrote several technical blogs for members of Tubiâ€™s Beijing Engineering Team, ensuring their expertise was effectively communicated to a broader audience.

* **[How a Seamless Play Single-Player Improved the Tubi Viewing Experience](https://code.tubitv.com/how-a-seamless-play-single-player-improved-the-tubi-viewing-experience-70933bcb68f9)**: This blog tells the story of why Tubi switched from a two-player system to a single player system to stream content.
* **[Tubiâ€™s New Android Player Architecture Supports All Playback Scenarios](https://code.tubitv.com/tubis-new-android-player-architecture-supports-all-playback-scenarios-322ee3a7153c)**: This blog describes how Tubi Engineers designed a data-driven MVP (Model-View-Presenter) layered architecture to support the playerâ€™s current functionalities and future evolutionhe new single player.
* **[Tubi-a-thon](https://code.tubitv.com/tubi-a-thon-2023-1624ac03056)**: Each year Tubi has a hackathon. This blog describes the winning demos from 2023.
  
I edited and revised the following technical blogs, originally written by members of Tubi's Machine Learning and Data Science Teams, to ensure technical accuracy, clarity, conciseness, and structural flow.

* **[Powering Personalized Binge-Watching: A Journey of Real Time Multi-Interest Based Retrieval](https://code.tubitv.com/powering-personalized-binge-watching-a-journey-of-real-time-multi-interest-based-retrieval-8aa39ed127a)**: This blog describes how Tubi leveraged 70+ models to personalize user experiences through retrieval and ranking systems for improved binge-watching.
* **[Tubi Time Series KPIs Outliers Detection](https://code.tubitv.com/tubi-time-series-kpis-outliers-detection-39e5b994fba)**: This blog describes a new alerting system that detects outliers and trends in our Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) developed by Tubi's Data Science Team. 

  
### Ad Blog Series

I wrote a series of ad-focused blogs detailing Tubiâ€™s technical process for selling, promoting, and personalizing ads. Each blog was created from scratch using Tubi Engineering documentation and ChatGPT. The goal of this series was to help new hires understand the various ways Tubi works with ads.

- **[How Tubi uses Real-Time Bidding to Sell Ads](https://github.com/lizztest/lizzpowerlifter/blob/main/How%20Tubi%20uses%20Real-Time%20Bidding%20to%20Sell%20Ads%207aab1ffe49a0400a959c952360cdc3d7.pdf)**

### Tubi's Behind-the-Scenes Fireside Tech Chats

During the summer, Tubi hosted Behind-the-Scenes Fireside Tech Chats featuring prominent technology leaders. During these sessions, I transcribed the conversations in real time and extracted key takeaways designed to benefit emerging leaders. These insights were then published on Medium and LinkedIn.

## Technical Writing at VMware

As the sole tech writer for Tanzu Services and Solutions. I spent my time editing and rewriting a lot of technical content for the Tanzu Development Center. I also wrote my own blogs, including one about the cost of migrating to Kubernetes, and a learning path on how to create a cash card using a Rest API and Spring Boot. Both of these are behind a paywall that I cannot access. 

To help engineers write their own structured learning paths, I wrote a **[Spring Style Guide](https://github.com/lizztest/lizzpowerlifter/blob/main/Spring%20Style%20Guide.pdf)** to help them get started.
